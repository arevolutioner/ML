    "# A Quick Machine Learning Modelling Tutorial with Python and Scikit-Learn \n",
    "This notebook goes through a range of common and useful featues of the Scikit-Learn library.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's long but it's called quick because of how vast the Scikit-Learn library is. Covering everything requires a [full-blown documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), of which, if you ever get stuck, you should read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Scikit-Learn (sklearn)?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), also referred to as `sklearn`, is an open-source Python machine learning library.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's built on top on NumPy (Python library for numerical computing) and Matplotlib (Python library for data visualization).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://localhost:8888/files/sklearn-6-step-ml-framework-tools-scikit-learn-highlight.png\" alt=\"a 6 step machine learning framework along will tools you can use for each step\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Scikit-Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the field of machine learning is vast, the main goal is finding patterns within data and then using those patterns to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are certain categories which a majority of problems fall into.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict whether an email is spam and or not spam, you're working on a classification problem (whether something is something(s) or another).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict the price of houses given their characteristics, you're working on a regression problem (predicting a number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know what kind of problem you're working on, there are also similar steps you'll take for each. Steps like splitting the data into different sets, one for your machine learning algorithms to learn on and another to test them on.\n",
    "Choosing a machine learning model and then evaluating whether or not your model has learned anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn offers Python implementations for doing all of these kinds of tasks. Saving you having to build them from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What does this notebook cover?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-Learn library is very capable. However, learning everything off by heart isn't necessary. Instead, this notebook focuses some of the main use cases of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](sklearn-workflow-title.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "0. An end-to-end Scikit-Learn worfklow\n",
    "1. Getting the data ready\n",
    "2. Choosing the right maching learning estimator/aglorithm/model for your problem\n",
    "3. Fitting your chosen machine learning model to data and using it to make a prediction\n",
    "4. Evaluting a machine learning model\n",
    "5. Improving predictions through experimentation (hyperparameter tuning)\n",
    "6. Saving and loading a pretrained model\n",
    "7. Putting it all together in a pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** all of the steps in this notebook are focused on **supervised learning** (having data and labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "After going through it, you'll have the base knolwedge of Scikit-Learn you need to keep moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can I get help?\n",
    "If you get stuck or think of something you'd like to do which this notebook doesn't cover, don't fear!\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended steps you take are:\n",
    "1. **Try it** - Since Scikit-Learn has been designed with usability in mind, your first step should be to use what you know and try figure out the answer to your own question (getting it wrong is part of the process). If in doubt, run your code.\n",
    "2. **Press SHIFT+TAB** - See you can the docstring of a function (information on what the function does) by pressing **SHIFT + TAB** inside it. Doing this is a good habit to develop. It'll improve your research skills and give you a better understanding of the library. \n",
    "3. **Search for it** - If trying it on your own doesn't work, since someone else has probably tried to do something similar, try searching for your problem. You'll likely end up in 1 of 2 places:\n",
    "    * [Scikit-Learn documentation/user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - the most extensive resource you'll find for Scikit-Learn information.\n",
    "    * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is the developers Q&A hub, it's full of questions and answers of different problems across a wide range of software development topics and chances are, there's one related to your problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "An example of searching for a Scikit-Learn solution might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"how to tune the hyperparameters of a sklearn model\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching this on Google leads to the Scikit-Learn documentation for the `GridSearchCV` function: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps here are to read through the documentation, check the examples and see if they line up to the problem you're trying to solve. If they do, **rewrite the code** to suit your needs, run it, and see what the outcomes are.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 3 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). Be as specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you don't have to learn all of the functions off by heart to begin with. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's most important is continually asking yourself, \"what am I trying to do with the data?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by answering that question and then practicing finding the code which does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started."

    "It returns four columns: precision, recall, f1-score and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of rows will depend on how many different classes there are. But there will always be three rows labell accuracy, macro avg and weighted avg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each term measures something slightly different:\n",
    "* **Precision** - Indicates the proportion of positive identifications (model predicted class `1`) which were actually correct. A model which produces no false positives has a precision of 1.0.\n",
    "* **Recall** - Indicates the proportion of actual positives which were correctly classified. A model which produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0.\n",
    "* **F1 score** - A combination of precision and recall. A perfect model achieves an F1 score of 1.0.\n",
    "* **Support** - The number of samples each metric was calculated on.\n",
    "* **Accuracy** - The accuracy of the model in decimal form. Perfect accuracy is equal to 1.0, in other words, getting the prediction right 100% of the time.\n",
    "* **Macro avg** - Short for macro average, the average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Macro avg doesn't take class imbalance into effect. So if you do have class imbalances (more examples of one class than another), you should pay attention to this.\n",
    "* **Weighted avg** - Short for weighted average, the weighted average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Weighted means each metric is calculated with respect to how many samples there are in each class. This metric will favour the majority class (e.g. it will give a high value when one class out performs another due to having more samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "When should you use each?\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be tempting to base your classification models perfomance only on accuracy. And accuracy is a good metric to report, except when you have very imbalanced classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say there were 10,000 people. And 1 of them had a disease. You're asked to build a model to predict who has it.\n",
